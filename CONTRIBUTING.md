## 🏗️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- Git
- Docker (optional)

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/SecScanX.git
cd SecScanX

# Set up backend
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies

# Set up frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Set up CLI
cd ../cli
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
pytest tests/ -v

# Frontend tests  
cd frontend
npm test

# Linting
flake8 backend/
eslint frontend/src/
```

## 📋 Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names

```python
def analyze_vulnerabilities(scan_results: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyze vulnerability scan results and provide recommendations.
    
    Args:
        scan_results: List of vulnerability findings
        
    Returns:
        Dict containing analysis and recommendations
    """
    pass
```

### JavaScript/React (Frontend)

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript types
- Keep components focused and reusable

```javascript
const VulnerabilityCard = ({ vulnerability, onSelect }) => {
  const severityColor = getSeverityColor(vulnerability.severity);
  
  return (
    <Card className={`vulnerability-card ${vulnerability.severity.toLowerCase()}`}>
      {/* Component content */}
    </Card>
  );
};
```

### General Guidelines

- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Follow the existing project structure
- Keep commits atomic and well-described

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_scanner.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=modules tests/
```

### Frontend Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test
npm test Scanner.test.js

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Test Guidelines

- Write tests for new features
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for good test coverage
